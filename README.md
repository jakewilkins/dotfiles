## To install

First off, don't. These are mine, hands off.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jakewilkins/dotfiles.git ~/src/$(whoami)/dotfiles
```

```sh
cd ~/src/$(whoami)/dotfiles
```

```sh
./script/setup
```

Meant primarily for MacOS, but also works for [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) if that's your jam.
